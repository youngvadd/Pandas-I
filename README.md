Conclusion:
Weekly Sales: The histogram of weekly sales indicates a right-skewed distribution, 
              suggesting that there are relatively fewer instances of very high sales compared to lower sales amounts. 
              This could indicate occasional spikes in sales or a few high-performing periods.

Temperature and Unemployment: The histograms of temperature and unemployment show approximately normal distributions, 
                              indicating that the majority of the data points are centered around the mean with relatively few outliers. 
                              This suggests that these factors may follow typical patterns without significant deviations.

Fuel Price, CPI: The histograms of fuel price and CPI exhibit bimodal distributions, 
                 suggesting the presence of two distinct peaks or modes in the data. 
                 This could imply the existence of different market conditions or states within the dataset, 
                 potentially indicating varying economic situations or consumer behaviors.

Weekly sales have a weak negative correlation with temperature, fuel price, and unemployment. This means that as these variables increase, weekly sales tend to decrease slightly.
Weekly sales have a weak positive correlation with CPI. This means that as CPI increases, weekly sales tend to increase slightly.
Temperature has a weak positive correlation with fuel price, CPI, and unemployment.
Fuel price has a weak negative correlation with CPI.
CPI has a moderate negative correlation with unemployment.

Conclusion: Best Season by Year
2010: Spring
2011: Autumn
2012: Summer

Conclusion
Based on the analysis of holiday distribution over the years, 
it appears to be a typical scenario, with holiday percentages varying across different years. 
The overall holiday percentage, calculated as 6.99%, 
indicates that holidays occur in a relatively small proportion of the observed data points. 
Further investigation into the specific trends and patterns within each year may provide additional insights into holiday occurrences and their impact.
